      "question": "Explain the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).",
      "answer": "Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects – data structures consisting of data fields and methods together with their interactions – to design applications and computer programs. OOP aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction."

      "question": "How does the HTTP protocol work?",
      "answer": "HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext via the internet. In HTTP, a client, such as a web browser, sends a request to a server, and the server responds with the requested resource. HTTP operates as a request-response protocol over the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)."

      "question": "What are the benefits of using version control systems like Git?",
      "answer": "Version control systems, such as Git, provide numerous benefits, including the ability to track changes in code over time, collaborate with others seamlessly, revert to previous states of a project, manage branches for parallel development, and maintain a centralized repository. Git, in particular, is known for its speed, distributed nature, and efficiency in handling large projects."

      "question": "Explain the concept of a RESTful API.",
      "answer": "REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) adheres to the principles of REST and uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication. It emphasizes a stateless client-server interaction, resource-based URLs, and the representation of resources, often in JSON format. RESTful APIs are widely used in web development for building scalable and interoperable systems."
